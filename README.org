* Awesome WM 4.3 Configuration on Laptop

Awesome WM 4.3 configurations used on laptop. Derived originally from Holo theme of [[https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats][awesome-copycats]], the setup and theme evolved in the last two years.

The color theme now features the Carolina blue and other tweaks are according to the guide from this page: [[https://research.unc.edu/communications/branding/colors/][UNC Research Colors]].

More of libraries are from original awesome-copycats and awesome-opacity is also used here to control opacity of each client. I tailored the original awesome-opacity to my needs and the functions maybe totally different from the original version.

My only contribution is the wallpaper package, whose main function is to offer the set random wallpaper periodically when =beautiful.wallpaper= set to a directory. The random wallpaper supports multiple (two currently) profiles and could be toggled from menu (I don't want everyone see an anime girl/boy or some game screenshots on my screen at work).

It also allows user to "show desktop" but this function is a bit buggy (and has been buggy for a long time). If you show the desktop and create a new client before bringing back the old clients, all tags will be selected and you have to reset it (like moving a client to another tag). 

This configuration also comes with a brightness widget as I didn't find a usable library when I wrote it. I am not sure whether there is a better solution but my poorman's version works at least.

* Dependencies

- lfs (LuaFileSystem) is used in wallpaper package to loop through directory
- light is used to adjust brightness. You could use xbacklight if you're NOT using the modesetting driver.

The other tools like =amixer= should usually come from the distribution.
